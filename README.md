# Online/Offline Budget Tracker

## What
The objective of this assignment was to create a budget tracker so a user can track how much money is coming in and going out of their account. 

## Why
This assignement was meant to give us practice with making our apps function both online and offline using IndexedDB. 

## Features

A user can update their spending whether they are online or offline. If they are using the application offline, once they go back online their changes will remain the app.
